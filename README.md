# Creative-Inspiration
This is a program I created to help aid creative writers whenever they need inspiration. 
Instructions:
  1. Download all text files and the creativeinspiration.py file.
  2. Run the creativeinspiration.py file in terminal.
  3. When you see "Enter a prompt", enter in any prompt of your choice.
  4. When asked "How many words would you like to look back (in digit form)?", enter the numerical amount of words you would like to look for in your prompt starting from the right side of it.
  5. Enjoy the wide array of words you have found!
